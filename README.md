This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over arrays. The `Bug.java` file contains code that attempts to access an array index beyond its valid range. This results in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The `BugSolution.java` file provides a corrected version of the code.
